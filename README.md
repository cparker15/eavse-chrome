============

Eavse for Chrome: Read the Web with ease.

**What's in a name?**

* _Eavse_ is a stylized form of the extension's original name, _eAVSe_, which stands for _​**e**lectronic **A**​udio **V**​isual **S**​ynesthesia **e**​xtension​_. The end goal of this extension is to provide a seamless integration of auditory and visual cues, synchronizing the senses of sight and hearing to provide a streamlined reading experience.

* It's one letter away from the word _ease_, which is the what this extension intends to do: ease the user into being able to read text that would normally be difficult or otherwise prohibitive.

* It's also an intentional misspelling of the word _eaves_, as in _eavesdropping_, an act of listening to something intently, with the goal of gleaning as much information as possible from what's being said.
